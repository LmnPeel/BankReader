# BankReader
Keeping track of finances is tedious, especially as a broke college student! This program takes in a monthly csv bank statement file and breakdown various spendings, then formats into calander form. It highlights large costs, calculates spending per week, and a few other useful features.

Written as a personal exercise on applying course knowledge by creating a useful program to make life easier.

More documentation is written in the python files.
